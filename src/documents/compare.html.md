## What we like about REST

We were stabbing in the dark before. We call those the dark days of api design. 

## 10 things I hate about you (REST)

We see REST as the ideal state, separate from the real world. The easy stuff should be eaiser. It was a thesis, not a roadmap. 

## RV as the way forward

We think any valid approach to API design should put the API designer and the API consumer front and center. Network topology be damned.
